dumplog.c is a small C program to send a periodic dump command out the
specified TTY device and to echo any data it receives.  Most other
scripts in this folder use it for receiving serial data.  Compile it
like so:

make dumplog

You can test it like so:

./dumplog /dev/tty.usbmodem12341

Most scripts in this folder already call it similarly using a
hard-coded TTY device.  The file dump contains an example shell command
that calls dumplog and filters out only the main temperature log out of
the received serial data.

fetch.sh, graph.sh, and log.sh were some test scripts to create a
Round-Robbin Database with rrdtool, load it up with data, and graph it.
The data collected via the shell command in dump needs to be inserted
with a series of commands like this:

rrdtool update test.rrd 920926680:123

With the first number replaced by an appropriate UNIX timestamp and the
second number with the corresponding temperature value.  This must be
done after a freshly created database with log.sh.

octave.m is an Octave script to graph the same data, but stored in a
two-column CSV file called rrds.csv.

The series of scripts starting with monitor were the scripts used for
the actual demo.  First, a new RRD database is created via
monitor-start.sh and then it a running log can be started by running
monitor2.sh.  An older, basic version that merely printed out
temperatures and sounded an alarm is in monitor.sh.  monitor2.sh is
merely a small wrapper around monitor2.pl which does the real work.
Once some data has been collected, it can be graphed with
monitor-graph.sh which will create a graph of the last hour of data.
